HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by using elements and tags.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
